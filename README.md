Deliverables
Your iteration deliverable is to create a README with the following. As you craft your answers, consider how you might talk about these same topics in a job interview after you graduate.

A 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.

A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design. -->

Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.

<!-- From the futbol_spec_harness directory, in the command line run bundle exec rspec. This will run a test suite for the StatTracker class as described in the project page.

In order for the test suite to run, all requirement statements inside your project's lib directory need to be require_relative rather than require. For example, if in your stat_tracker.rb file you have a line:

require './lib/helper_class'
You should change it to use a require_relative:

require_relative './helper_class'
<!-- You do not need to change any of the require statements inside your spec directory. -->
