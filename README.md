<!-- # Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.edu/) Futbol project.

Deliverables
Your iteration deliverable is to create a README with the following. As you craft your answers, consider how you might talk about these same topics in a job interview after you graduate.

A 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.

A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design. -->

Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.

to use spec_harness:

double check: Change into the futbol_spec_harness directory and run bundle from the command line. If you get an error that says the bundle command cannot be found, run gem install bundle from the command line and try again.

to use spec harness quickly, run this command from futbol_spec_harness: bundle exec rspec --format documentation 

*may have to kill terminal or let it run its course (the last 4 take like 1 minute a piece). afterward control c + control c. 
```


/// RETRO: ///

The name of and links (if applicable) to any tools you used for retro: 

No formal tools were used to format our retro, we all took notes and used topics of discussion to address past issues, formulate plans for the future, and we did use the Projects tab in GitHub for organizing work that had been done, needed to be done, or was in progress.
--------------------------------------------
Top 3 things that went well during your project:

1. Communication was of the utmost importance to our group, something we discussed at length in our DTR and in our daily meetings. We were able to keep open lines of communication through slack text & slack huddles to accomplish tasks and complete the project.

2. Streamlining. We were able to streamline .csv files to create shorter versions which were invaluable while going through the testing process. We were also able to streamline the processing speed of the data used, cutting down load times during testing significantly.

3. Flexibility in working environments was very productive. We worked in meetings as a full group of four, pairing off and using the driver/navigator method, as well as tackling the project async as individuals. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
Top 3 things your team would do differently next time:

1. Utilize the Spec Harness as a tool much sooner. There were many re-factoring efforts that could have been avoided had we established and continued to utilize the Spec Harness early on in the project.

2. Coordinated pull requests and branch management in a more orderly fashion. This caused sync issues as well as merge conflicts that likely could have been avoided. Learning how to keep the most up to date main branch is very important, and resolving pull requests in a timely manner could have saved us a few headaches.

3. Closing out the project could have been handled with a stronger push in the day prior. We had some testing and method issues that came down to the wire, whereas in hindsight we should have had a firm grasp on these issues sooner and avoided crunching prior to turning in the project.
